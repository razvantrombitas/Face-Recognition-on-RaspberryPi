# Face Recognition on RaspberryPi
The project supposes to implement a face recognition module based on a deep network with an illustration of the functionality on an embedded device. The chosen embedded device is a RaspberryPi 4 Model B board with 4GB of RAM which runs the latest version of Raspian OS. 

The Face Recognition part was done by using Transfer Learning on MobileNet (MobileNet is the neural network architecture used in this project). Transfer learning (TL) is a research problem in machine learning (ML) that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem. For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks.
My approach was based on the ‘fine tuning’ concept which means taking weights of a trained neural network and using it as initialization for a new model being trained on data from the same domain (e.g. images). The main reasons for using this concept are: speed up the training, overcome small dataset size. The pre-trained network (using Imagenet database) was used with Tensorflow and with Keras which is a ML framework. The learning rate, the batch size, and the number of epochs were modified in order to get better values for accuracy. The improvements were analyzed using the trial-and-error approach.
